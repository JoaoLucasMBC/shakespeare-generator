1. Karpathy (2015): “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks”
Andrej Karpathy’s influential blog post explores training character‐level RNNs on various text corpora, including the complete works of Shakespeare. By concatenating all of Shakespeare’s plays into a single 4.4 MB training file, Karpathy trained multi‐layer LSTM networks that learn to predict the next character in a sequence. Samples generated by his char‐RNN convincingly mimic Shakespearean syntax and formatting (e.g., speaker names, stage directions, iambic‐like lines), even without explicit rhyme or meter supervision. Although Karpathy did not report quantitative metrics like perplexity in formal tables, he demonstrated that his RNN can achieve low cross‐entropy and produce coherent, playable text excerpted as dialogue (“PANDARUS: Alas, I think he shall be come approached…”)

. This work laid the groundwork for nearly all subsequent “Shakespeare generation” efforts by showing that RNN‐based models can implicitly learn long‐range dependencies (e.g., line breaks, character names) directly from raw text.

2. Lau et al. (2018): “Deep‐speare: A Joint Neural Model of Poetic Language, Meter and Rhyme”
Lau et al. propose a multi‐component LSTM architecture specifically designed to capture three essential aspects of Shakespearean sonnets: language, meter, and rhyme. They train bidirectional word‐ and character‐level LSTMs on a corpus of 2,700 Shakespeare sonnets. A separate “stress model” learns iambic pentameter by labeling each syllable as stressed or unstressed, while a “rhyme model” enforces rhyme patterns by predicting end‐of‐line phonetic embeddings from a pretrained pronunciation dictionary. During generation, the joint architecture samples word sequences under meter constraints and then adjusts word endings to satisfy a target rhyme scheme (e.g., ABAB CDCD EFEF GG). Lau et al. evaluate on both automatic metrics (perplexity, stress‐accuracy) and expert human judgments, finding that their system’s outputs are often indistinguishable from human‐written sonnets in early blind tests—but still lag behind in “emotional resonance” and readability. Their crowd evaluation reports a test perplexity around ~3.2, while expert judges highlight the importance of explicit rhyme supervision for high‐quality sonnets

. Deep‐speare is the first work to show that combining meter and rhyme supervision leads to more convincing Shakespearean poetry.

3. Jhamtani et al. (2017): “Shakespearizing Modern Language Using Copy‐Enriched Sequence-to-Sequence Models”
Rather than generating new sonnets from scratch, Jhamtani et al. address style transfer—transforming Modern English sentences into Shakespearean‐style English. Their model is a copy-enriched encoder–decoder (pointer‐generator) network trained on a small parallel corpus of Modern ⇄ Shakespearean sentence pairs. They pretrain embeddings using an external dictionary that maps archaic Shakespearean words to their Modern English equivalents, thereby bootstrapping the mapping even for low‐frequency tokens. At test time, the pointer mechanism allows the model to output either a copied source token (modern word) or generate a target token (Shakespearean word), while attention weights guide alignment. Evaluated on BLEU, their best model achieves a BLEU of ~31.4 versus ~25.0 for a vanilla seq2seq baseline. They also demonstrate that incorporating part-of-speech constraints and phonetic features improves archaic word selection. Although this work focuses on transformation of existing text rather than de novo generation, it illustrates the value of explicit linguistic supervision (e.g., lexicons for archaicism), which informs our decision to annotate rhyme tokens and line breaks in our sonnet generator

4. Benhardt et al. (2018): “Shall I Compare Thee to a Machine-Written Sonnet? An Approach to Algorithmic Sonnet Generation”
Benhardt, Hase, Zhu, and Rudin present a Transformer-based sonnet generator that extends prior LSTM-based methods by leveraging self‐attention to better capture long-range structure. Their architecture is a decoder‐only transformer (similar to GPT-1), fine-tuned on a curated corpus of 4,000 Shakespeare sonnets. They incorporate several novel constraints: (1) in-line punctuation tokens to preserve punctuation patterns, (2) part-of-speech restrictions to avoid ungrammatical sequences, and (3) a specialized rhyme dictionary to enforce the ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme at each quatrain. During generation, they apply constrained sampling so that each line ends with a word drawn from the same rhyme class as its paired line. Their system was the 2018 winner of the PoetiX Literary Turing Test; expert judges rated the output sonnets nearly indistinguishable from human‐written ones in ~70 % of cases. Quantitatively, they report a self-BLEU score of 0.24 and a held-out perplexity of ~4.7, outperforming a GPT-2 baseline (perplexity ~6.1)

. This work demonstrates that adding explicit rhyme and POS constraints on top of a transformer yields more metrically and grammatically coherent sonnets than vanilla autoregressive sampling.
